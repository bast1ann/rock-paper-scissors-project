# Rock Paper Scissors
In this project I'm going to design the game "Rock Paper Scissors" using what I've learned from Javascript with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).


## [LIVE PREVIEW](https://bast1ann.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-project/)

## UPDATE
I revisited this project to add a basic UI and apply what I've learned from DOM manipulation and events.
